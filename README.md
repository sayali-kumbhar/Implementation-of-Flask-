# Implementation-of-Flask<br>
this is simple web application using flask<br>
for creating Web app,first step is train the model<br>
the dataset is used for this is Health expense dataset <br>
link for dataset is :-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance <br>
The data basically aims to predict the individual healthcare expenses given age, family details, BMI, gender.<br>
main aim is to understand the development of flask applications for any machine learning model.<br>
for training model linear Regression algorithm is used <br>
the accuracy of model is 79% <br>
steps for flask implementation:-<br>
1.Creating HTML page in templates folder<br>
In HTML form I have used a dynamic URL building.It means that when a form is submitted then where should a user be redirected. in form whenever the to submit button will be triggered then it will call to prediction URL and flask application will capable to access the data.<br>
url_for this method is used for achieving this task.<br>
2.Creating Flask application:<br>
3.Run the Flask app
